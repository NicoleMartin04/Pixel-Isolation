# Pixel-Isolation
Pixel Isolation is a web-based art project that explores video games and escapism. Using 3D models and Google's Model Viewer, it reflects on control, identity, and withdrawal into virtual spaces. It invites viewers to reflect on the balance between digital immersion and real-world connection.
